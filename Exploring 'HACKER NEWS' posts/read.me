 IN THIS PROJECTS:
 1- I have proved that 'ask post' have more comments on average than any other type posts.
 2- I have found the time when max user are active and the ask post that was posted on that time of the day gets maximum number of 
 comments so IF A PERSON POSTS A QUERY AT THAT TIME HE WILL GET MAX SUPPORT..
